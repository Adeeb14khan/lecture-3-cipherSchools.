# Java DSA Problem: Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters

This project demonstrates a high-quality Java solution to the classic DSA problem:

> **Given a string s, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.**

## Problem (Leetcode #3)
Example:
- Input: `"abcabcbb"`
- Output: `3` (because `"abc"` is the longest substring without repeating characters).

## Solution Approach

We use the **sliding window technique** with a `HashSet` to check for repeated characters efficiently.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository
2. Compile the code
